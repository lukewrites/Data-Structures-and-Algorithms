# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukewrites/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukewrites/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms)
Coursework for the [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) Coursera sequence by UCSD. I am keeping a blog about the courses (link will go here).

Coursework has been solved using TDD; Travis-CI keeps me honest on the tests.

Course descriptions are below. The individual course folders contain descriptions of each week's projects.

## Courses

### 1. [**Algorithmic Toolbox**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/home/welcome)
> The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).
